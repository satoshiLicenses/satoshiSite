        <h1 class="heading-2">12 Copyright Licenses that combine Creative Commons' standards and Blockchains</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-2"><br>All our licenses follow the same structure: creative work is published under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons License</a> and a <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CCPlus" target="_blank">CC Plus</a> Agreement that grants rights equivalent to a more permissive Creative Commons License to owners of the Associated Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).<br>
          
          <h3><b>PRIMARY CC LICENSE  =>  FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC<br><br>
          REFERENCE CC LICENSE   =>  FOR THE OWNER OF THE ASSOCIATED NFT</b></h3>
          
          <br>This means that creators can easily trade Copyright permissions to their work without the need of an agent, lawyer, or publisher. Furthermore, you can license your work under more than one Satoshi License (as long as the Primary CC licenses are <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Wiki/cc_license_compatibility" target="_blank">compatible</a>) in case you wish to trade different permissions.<br><br>Notice that Satoshi Licenses with the ShareAlike condition, both in the Primary and the Reference CC Licenses, expect derivative works to be published under the Primary CC License or an equivalent license. This is the case because the CC+ Protocol can only grant further permissions but never restrict the parent CC license.<br><br> <br><h3><i>“Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
          trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
          most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.”</i> – S. Nakamoto</h3><br><br><br><br><span class="text-span"><em class="italic-text">Contact: satoshi.licenses@gmail.com</em></span><br><br>‍<br>‍</p>
